A system designed for remote control and configuration of microcontrollers. It consists of two main components: a microcontroller and a web interface. 

The microcontroller executes server instructions and interacts with connected components, while the web interface allows users to configure settings, manage firmware, and design workflows through a visual interface. This solution provides flexibility and simplicity for managing electronic systems remotely.
